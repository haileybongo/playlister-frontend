Welcome to Playlister! This is the front end of a song search and playlist creation application. This is not currently deployed and is set to run on local host. To get this up and running, clone this repository as well as the back end repository. Once the back end is installed and the server is running, run 'npm start' on this repository.

This project is a song search and playlist application. It uses the SpotifY API to generate a list of songs based on user inputs for genres and preferred levels of acousticness, dancability, energy, and popularity. Once songs load from the API, they can then be played or added to a playlist. Playlists can be created and browsed by all users.
